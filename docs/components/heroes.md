# Hero Variants

Status: Individual hero statuses are recorded in the Showcase registry. Image Overlay Hero and Minimal Hero are In Review; the remaining hero variants are Draft.

## Purpose

Heroes introduce a module, course, or scenario. Choose the layout that gives the learner enough context without making the opening screen feel busy.

## Variants

- `ImageOverlayHero`: Full-width local image with controlled Dark, Light or Brand colour overlays and an optional eyebrow and description.
- `SplitHero`: Text and actions alongside an image; it stacks with text first on narrow screens.
- `MinimalHero`: Text-first opening with controlled center or left alignment, Standard or Display title scale, Compact, Standard or Spacious density, and approved light or brand surfaces.
- `FloatingCardHero`: Large image with a solid text card that overlays on wider screens and flows below the image on narrow screens.
- `LearningObjectivesHero`: Module context, introduction, two to five objectives, and a start action.
- `ScenarioOpenerHero`: Scenario context, situation, learner challenge, and an enter action. An optional local image can be supplied.

## Shared Actions

Most hero variants use `HeroActions` through an `actions` prop. Each action needs `href` and `label`; set `variant: "secondary"` for a secondary action. `ImageOverlayHero` deliberately uses one optional `action` instead, with button styling derived from its text treatment.

## Showcase Display Options

Each showcase preview has native controls for its optional eyebrow, supporting text, and available actions. The controls use small, Showcase-only scripts to update rendered review content in place. They are not learner-facing controls, production authoring controls or Boilerplate content.

## Minimal Hero

Status: In Review

Use Minimal Hero for a prominent text-first opening where imagery would not add useful learning or visual context. It supports `alignment="center" | "left"`, `headingScale="standard" | "display"`, `density="compact" | "standard" | "spacious"`, and the controlled `default`, `neutral`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent` and `light` surfaces. The component applies the matching foreground and action treatment for the selected surface.

`eyebrow`, `summary` and `actions` are optional. Supply zero, one or two actions only; actions use `HeroActions` and retain the standard primary and secondary variants. Centered actions are centred, while left-aligned actions follow the course content edge. Titles and summaries use governed readable measures and wrap naturally without fixed heights.

Minimal Hero has no image, media slot, JavaScript or hero-specific animation. Its Showcase uses one canonical preview with independent controls for alignment, surface, heading scale, density, optional content and up to two action labels. Use Image Overlay Hero when a local image earns its place, and Section Divider or Chapter Opener for a lighter structural transition within a longer course. Brand surfaces and Display scale are strongest when used selectively rather than on every section.

## Image Overlay Hero

Status: In Review

Use this opener when a course image provides useful context and the text needs a protected reading area. It supports `dark`, `light` and `brand` overlay styles. Brand overlays accept a hexadecimal brand colour and fall back to a controlled blue when no valid colour is supplied. It may include one optional action; Light text uses a white action button and Dark text uses a dark action button.

`bleed="viewport"` is an optional page-level presentation mode for a course opener. It lets the image field reach the viewport edges while the existing text measure remains aligned to the governed course grid. The default `bleed="container"` preserves the component specimen and existing embedded use. `headingLevel` is optional and defaults to `4`, allowing a production course composition to retain its proper document outline without changing existing output.

Choose `light` or `dark` text deliberately. Dark overlay normally pairs with Light text; Light overlay normally pairs with Dark text. A Brand colour overlay needs a final contrast review using the actual course image and content. The component does not analyse image brightness automatically.

Use `standard` title emphasis for normal or descriptive course headings. Use `display` title emphasis for short, high-impact wording. The component owns responsive sizing and wrapping, so course creators should not choose arbitrary pixel sizes. Keep hero copy concise, but longer headings wrap naturally and increase the hero height when needed.

`eyebrow` and `description` are optional. Empty or whitespace-only values do not render an empty element or spacing. `title` and `imageSrc` remain required; use meaningful image alternative text when the image conveys course context.

The Image Overlay Hero Showcase adds temporary options for overlay, text, title emphasis and short, standard, long and custom content. These inputs are review tooling only. They are not learner-facing controls, production authoring controls or Boilerplate content.

## Accessibility

- Use meaningful local-image `alt` text when an image communicates course context.
- Keep the overlay variant's text on the contrast-preserving side of the image.
- Choose Dark overlay with Light text for bright imagery, and Light overlay with Dark text for dark imagery. Avoid pale brand colours with Light text and dark brand colours with Dark text.
- Use one concise heading and one supporting paragraph.
- Keep objective lists between two and five items.
- Link actions to real course destinations and keep their labels explicit.
